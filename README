A utility that converts animated images from the standard GIF format to an uncompressed GIF wrapped in gzip.

Dependencies:
    — ImageMagick
    — libungif

ImageMagick can be replaced with gifsicle, although this may corrupt some animation files.

Usage example:
    ./bolkedgif anim.gif anim.gif-gz

To let a browser display this format, add the following lines to your .htaccess file (for Apache):

    AddEncoding gzip .gif-gz
    AddType image/gif .gif-gz

P.S. Project status: proof of concept. The proof didn't quite succeed—the GIF was compressed, but the resulting file is larger than the original.
